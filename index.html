		<h1> About Sarah</h3>

<!-- Everything you never wanted to know about me. Enjoy! -->

		<h3> Past life</h2>
		<p>I'm a former 911-dispatcher. About five years ago, I said, <strong>TO HELL WITH IT </strong> and changed professions and became tech support for a software startup, who were <em>super shady </em> unfortunately. </p>
		
		<h3> Current Life</h3>

		<p>Since then, I have continued to improve my skills, got several <strong> way better jobs </strong> and now I'm currently a Software Quality Assurance Manager for the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, at <a href="http://echo.unm.edu"> Project ECHO </a></p>	

		<h3> Next Life </h3>

		<p>On August 28th, 2016, I'm marrying a guy named Brian. I'm looking forward to it, and <em>I hope</em> he feels the same way.</p>

		<p> Brian and I have a honeymoon registry where you can give us money. Please do so! <a href="http://www.honeyfund.com/weddings/boshswanson" target="_blank" title="Honeyfund Honeymoon Registry"> GIVE ME MONEY HERE! </a></p>

		<p> To send your well-wishes in lieu of money because you're <em>extremely stingy</em>, <a href="mailto:brisarabq@gmail.com"> You can do that right here.</a></p>

<!-- I switch to talking crap about cats from here down, please don't dox me. I'm typically a nice person -->

		<h4>Cats are evil</h4>
			<p>Cats aren't <em>really</em> evil, but they are Kryptonite to me. If you want to see someone in <strong>agony</strong>, put me in a room a cat has ever existed in, and you will see suffering.</p>

		<h4>Cat Haiku:</h4>
			Felines are not fine <br/>
			It's called a catastrophe <br/>
			For a good reason.<br/>

				<li>Destroyer of Worlds</li>
				<li>Diablo</li>
